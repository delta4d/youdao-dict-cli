youdao-dict-cli
---------------

A simple [youdao dict](http://dict.youdao.com/) cli ver.
Function is very limited, translating from English to Chinese works fine.
But it is a good way to practice ruby and gems, I may add more functions when I come up with some good ideas and muchmore ruby skills.

installation
------------

```
gem install youdao_dict_cli
```

using
-----

```
$ ydict blah blah
Usage:
  ydict [arg]
  no arguments: starting translating! enter bye to exit the program
  any arguments: display this help

$ ydict
>> # type the word, or 'bye' to exit
```
